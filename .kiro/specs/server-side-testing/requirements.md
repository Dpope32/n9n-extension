# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on implementing comprehensive server-side testing for the n9n AI Copilot Chrome extension's Supabase backend operations. The testing suite will validate all CRUD operations for conversations and messages, ensuring data integrity and proper error handling while the client-side issues are being resolved.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive tests for Supabase CRUD operations, so that I can ensure the backend functionality works correctly while debugging client-side issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the test suite runs THEN the system SHALL validate all conversation CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)
2. WHEN the test suite runs THEN the system SHALL validate all message CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)
3. WHEN tests execute THEN the system SHALL use a dedicated test database or test data isolation
4. WHEN tests complete THEN the system SHALL clean up all test data automatically
5. IF any CRUD operation fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information and stack traces

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test error handling and edge cases, so that I can ensure the application gracefully handles failures and unexpected scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network requests fail THEN the system SHALL test fallback to localStorage behavior
2. WHEN invalid data is provided THEN the system SHALL validate proper error responses
3. WHEN Supabase is unavailable THEN the system SHALL test offline functionality
4. WHEN concurrent operations occur THEN the system SHALL test data consistency
5. IF authentication fails THEN the system SHALL test anonymous user handling

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated test execution and reporting, so that I can quickly identify issues and track test coverage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are executed THEN the system SHALL provide detailed test reports with pass/fail status
2. WHEN tests run THEN the system SHALL measure and report test execution time
3. WHEN tests complete THEN the system SHALL generate coverage reports for tested functionality
4. IF tests fail THEN the system SHALL provide actionable debugging information
5. WHEN tests are run multiple times THEN the system SHALL ensure consistent results

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test data validation and business logic, so that I can ensure data integrity and proper application behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN messages are created THEN the system SHALL validate required fields (role, content, conversation_id)
2. WHEN conversations are created THEN the system SHALL validate title length limits and user_id requirements
3. WHEN data is retrieved THEN the system SHALL validate proper sorting and filtering
4. WHEN updates occur THEN the system SHALL validate only allowed fields are modified
5. IF invalid UUIDs are provided THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want performance and load testing capabilities, so that I can ensure the backend can handle expected usage patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple conversations are created rapidly THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent operations
2. WHEN large message volumes are processed THEN the system SHALL maintain acceptable response times
3. WHEN pagination is tested THEN the system SHALL validate proper data retrieval limits
4. WHEN stress tests run THEN the system SHALL identify performance bottlenecks
5. IF rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL test proper throttling behavior
