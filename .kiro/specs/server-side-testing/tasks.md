  - Implement tests for network interruption during operations
  - Test partial data synchronization scenarios between Supabase and localStorage
  - Verify data consistency when switching between online and offline modes
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.3_

- [ ] 7. Implement integration tests for complete chat flows
  - Create end-to-end test for: start conversation → add messages → save → load → update cycle
