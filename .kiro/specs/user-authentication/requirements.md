# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The n9n AI Copilot extension needs user authentication to provide personalized experiences, secure access to AI models, and persistent conversation history. Users will authenticate within the webapp interface, which connects to Supabase for backend authentication and user management. This feature will enable user identification, session management, and secure access to premium features.

### Requirement 5
